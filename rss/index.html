The end-user license agreement has made it clear for a while that you can&#x2019;t own any content created within Minecraft. So on July 20, 2022 when Minecraft published an <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-and-nfts" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">article </a>clarifying its stance on NFTs and blockchain it came as no surprise.</p><p>The problem with monolithic companies like Microsoft is that they get so big it nearly becomes impossible for them to innovate. Rather than taking big risks and being forward thinking they double down on a policy that lacks innovation. This stems from a fundamental lack of understanding when it comes to blockchain technology.</p><p>Take this sentence from the article in reference to NFTs, &#x201C;Yet, with any digital file, that file can be copied, moved, or even deleted.&#x201D; Let&#x2019;s take a look at this statement to see if Minecraft really knows what they are talking about shall we.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://bmmp.pages.dev/content/images/2022/08/f9e57c2e43514dabbdd481e97f9133cc.png" class="kg-image" alt="District 53 the solution for Minecrafts killjoy" loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="http://bmmp.pages.dev/content/images/size/w600/2022/08/f9e57c2e43514dabbdd481e97f9133cc.png 600w, http://bmmp.pages.dev/content/images/size/w1000/2022/08/f9e57c2e43514dabbdd481e97f9133cc.png 1000w, http://bmmp.pages.dev/content/images/size/w1600/2022/08/f9e57c2e43514dabbdd481e97f9133cc.png 1600w, http://bmmp.pages.dev/content/images/2022/08/f9e57c2e43514dabbdd481e97f9133cc.png 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>possess unique identifie</figcaption></figure><p><strong>A.</strong> NFTs can be copied. NFTs possess unique identifiers or tokenIDs that explicitly make clear which copy is the true one and only original. It&#x2019;s similar to a certificate of authentication received when purchasing a physical piece of artwork. Just like some rando can paint a near perfect copy of the Mona Lisa, people can right click, copy and save NFTs. The fact that it can be copied is irrelevant because there is only one authenticated copy of the NFT recorded on the blockchain. With decentralized blockchains anyone can verify whether your NFT is real or fake. If it&#x2019;s a copy then it is fake and it will have zero value. Somehow Minecraft fails to make this connection in the article.<strong>B.</strong> NFTs can be moved. It&#x2019;s not clear what Minecraft means by moved. Do they mean moving on and off the blockchain? Most NFTs don&#x2019;t move, they stay on the native blockchain they minted on unless they were designed to interoperate between different blockchains (which is rare at this time). It&#x2019;s more likely that Minecraft means the transfer of property rights. Transferring ownership of digital goods is a benefit, not a hindrance, as it can increase the value and utility of that NFT in the game. From what I know Minecraft players want the option to move rare items to a blockchain. Take Netherite diamond armor for example. For anyone not familiar with Minecraft, Netherite is an incredibly rare and difficult material to get. Finding it is a big accomplishment and can take a lot of time and energy to achieve. However, if a player dies they may lose their Netherite armor or have it stolen. This is why gamers want to be able to secure, share and transfer their valuable items on a decentralized blockchain. Minecraft doesn&#x2019;t agree and it will be to their detriment.<strong>C.</strong> NFTs can be deleted. This is wrong. NFTs that exist on a decentralized blockchain ledger do not randomly disappear and can&#x2019;t be deleted. The entire blockchain would have to disappear for this to happen. Only on centralized servers does this often occur. Perhaps in the future Minecraft will allow NFTs but only on a centralized blockchain so they can delete the NFTs of those who oppose them!</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Coming soon]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>This is MakeMyPrivacy Blog, a brand new site by MakeMyPrivacy that&apos;s just getting started.
